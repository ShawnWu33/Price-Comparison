# Price-Comparison

This is the web app developed for applying junior developer in Ynomia.
The website is a flask-based web application, which search the item inputted in both BigW and David Jones website to retrieve price of items in different stores.
It just a demo so I only put two websites in comparison. For comparing more stores, the back-end database and crawler must be used.

For demostrating the function, you can input "Tefal Garment Steamer" in textbox and click "Search", or item you want to do a price comparison between stores.
